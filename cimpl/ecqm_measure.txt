Description: "Assessed for Rehabilitation (STK-10). Each year about 700,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke, which is the nation's third leading cause of death. Approximately two thirds of these individuals survive and require rehabilitation. Stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States, with about 4.4 million stroke survivors alive today. Forty percent of stroke patients are left with moderate functional impairment and 15 to 30 percent with severe disability. More than 60% of those who have experienced stroke, serious injury, or a disabling disease have never received rehabilitation. Stroke rehabilitation should begin as soon as the diagnosis of stroke is established and life-threatening problems are under control. Among the high priorities for stroke are to mobilize the patient and encourage resumption of self-care activities as soon as possible. A considerable body of evidence indicates better clinical outcomes when patients with stroke are treated in a setting that provides coordinated, multidisciplinary stroke-related evaluation and services. Effective rehabilitation interventions initiated early following stroke can enhance the recovery process and minimize functional disability. The primary goal of rehabilitation is to prevent complications, minimize impairments, and maximize function."

Description: "Discharged on Antithrombotic Therapy (STK-02). The effectiveness of antithrombotic agents in reducing stroke mortality, stroke-related morbidity and recurrence rates has been studied in several large clinical trials. While the use of these agents for patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks continues to be the subject of study, substantial evidence is available from completed studies. Data at this time suggest that antithrombotic therapy should be prescribed at discharge following acute ischemic stroke to reduce stroke mortality and morbidity as long as no contraindications exist. For patients with a stroke due to a cardioembolic source (eg atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valve), warfarin is recommended unless contraindicated. In recent years, novel oral anticoagulant agents (NOACs) have been developed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention, and may be considered as an alternative to warfarin for select patients. Anticoagulation therapy is not generally recommended for secondary stroke prevention in patients presumed to have a non-cardioembolic stroke. Anticoagulants at doses to prevent venous thromboembolism are insufficient antithrombotic therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA."

Description: "Discharged on Statin Medication (STK-06). There is an extensive and consistent body of evidence supporting the use of statins for secondary prevention in patients with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which includes individuals with ischemic stroke due to large artery atherosclerosis, individuals with ischemic stroke due to intrinsic small vessel disease, and individuals with ischemic stroke not directly due to atherosclerosis but with clinically evident atherosclerotic disease in an uninvolved cerebral or noncerebral bed.  Both women and men with clinical ASCVD are at increased risk for recurrent ASCVD and ASCVD death.  High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men less than or equal to 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated. In patients with clinical ASCVD and a contraindication to high-intensity statin therapy, moderate-intensity therapy should be considered as an alternative if it can be tolerated.  In individuals greater than 75 years of age, the potential for ASCVD risk reduction benefits, adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences should be considered, and statin therapy individualized based on these considerations (Stone, 2013)."

Description: "Stroke Education (STK-08). There are many examples of how patient education programs for specific chronic conditions have increased healthful behaviors, improved health status, and/or decreased health care costs of their participants. Clinical practice guidelines include recommendations for patient and family education during hospitalization as well as information about resources for social support services. Some clinical trials have shown measurable benefits in patient and caregiver outcomes with the application of education and support strategies. The type of stroke experienced and the resulting outcomes will play a large role in determining not only the course of treatment but also what education will be required. Patient education should include information about the event (eg, cause, treatment, and risk factors), the role of various medications or strategies, as well as desirable lifestyle modifications to reduce risk or improve outcomes. Family/caregivers will also need guidance in planning effective and realistic care strategies appropriate to the patient's prognosis and potential for rehabilitation."

Description: "Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis (VTE-1). Hospitalized patients at high-risk for VTE may develop an asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and die from pulmonary embolism (PE) even before the diagnosis is suspected. The majority of fatal events occur as sudden or abrupt death, underscoring the importance of prevention as the most critical action step for reducing death from PE (Geerts, et al, 2008). The estimated annual incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), known collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE), is approximately 900,000 (Geerts, et al, 2008). Approximately two-thirds of cases of DVT or PE are associated with recent hospitalization. This is consistent with the 2001 report by The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). AHRQ indicates that 'the appropriate application of effective preventive measures in hospitals has major potential for improving patient safety by reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism' (Shojania, 2001). Despite its proven effectiveness, rates of appropriate thromboprophylaxis remain low in both medical and surgical patients. A recent analysis from the ENDORSE survey, which evaluated prophylaxis rates in 17,084 major surgery patients, found that more than one third of patients at risk for VTE (38%) did not receive prophylaxis and that rates varied by surgery type (Cohen, et al., 2008). In a review of evidence-based patient safety practices, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality defined thromboprophylaxis against VTE as the 'number one patient safety practice' for hospitalized patients (Shojania, 2001). Updated 'safe practices' published by the National Quality Forum (NQF) recommend routine evaluation of hospitalized patients for risk of VTE and use of appropriate prophylaxis (National Quality Forum. National Voluntary Consensus Standards for Prevention and Care of Venous Thromboembolism, 2006). As noted by the ACCP, a vast number of randomized clinical trials provide irrefutable evidence that thromboprophylaxis reduces VTE events, and there are studies that have also shown that fatal PE is prevented by thromboprophylaxis (Geerts, et al. 2008). Some select surgeries have previously been monitored in the Surgical Care Improvement Project; since performance on these surgeries has achieved very high levels, they are not included in this measure."

Description: "Median Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients (ED-2). Reducing the time patients remain in the emergency department (ED) can improve access to treatment and increase quality of care. Reducing this time potentially improves access to care specific to the patient condition and increases the capability to provide additional treatment. In recent times, EDs have experienced significant overcrowding. Although once only a problem in large, urban, teaching hospitals, the phenomenon has spread to other suburban and rural healthcare organizations. According to a 2002 national U.S. survey, more than 90 percent of large hospitals report EDs operating 'at' or 'over' capacity. Approximately one third of hospitals in the U.S. report increases in ambulance diversion in a given year, whereas up to half report crowded conditions in the ED. In a recent national survey, 40 percent of hospital leaders viewed ED crowding as a symptom of workforce shortages. ED crowding may result in delays in the administration of medication such as antibiotics for pneumonia and has been associated with perceptions of compromised emergency care. For patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, long ED stays were associated with decreased use of guideline-recommended therapies and a higher risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. Overcrowding and heavy emergency resource demand have led to a number of problems, including ambulance refusals, prolonged patient waiting times, increased suffering for those who wait, rushed and unpleasant treatment environments, and potentially poor patient outcomes. When EDs are overwhelmed, their ability to respond to community emergencies and disasters may be compromised."

Description: "Elective Delivery (PC-01). For almost 3 decades, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have had in place a standard requiring 39 completed weeks gestation prior to ELECTIVE delivery, either vaginal or operative (ACOG, 1996). A survey conducted in 2007 of almost 20,000 births in HCA hospitals throughout the U.S. carried out in conjunction with the March of Dimes at the request of ACOG revealed that almost 1/3 of all babies delivered in the United States are electively delivered with 5% of all deliveries in the U.S. delivered in a manner violating ACOG/AAP guidelines. Most of these are for convenience, and result in significant short term neonatal morbidity (neonatal intensive care unit admission rates of 13- 21%) (Clark et al., 2009). According to Glantz (2005), compared to spontaneous labor, elective inductions result in more cesarean births and longer maternal length of stay. The American Academy of Family Physicians (2000) also notes that elective induction doubles the cesarean delivery rate. Repeat elective cesarean births before 39 weeks gestation also result in higher rates of adverse respiratory outcomes, mechanical ventilation, sepsis and hypoglycemia for the newborns (Tita et al., 2009)."

Description: "Childhood Immunization Status. Infants and toddlers are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases because their immune systems have not built up the necessary defenses to fight infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017a). Most childhood vaccines are between 90 and 99 percent effective in preventing diseases (HealthyChildren 2015).  Vaccination of each U.S. birth cohort with the current childhood immunization schedule prevents approximately 42,000 deaths and 20 million cases of disease, and saves nearly $14 billion in direct costs and $69 billion in societal costs each year (Zhou 2014). Immunizing a child not only protects that child's health but also the health of the community, especially for those who are not immunized or are unable to be immunized due to other health complications (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017b). When the majority of the community is immunized against a disease, other members of the community are also protected because herd immunity shields them.

Description: "Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Poor Control (> 9%). As the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., diabetes kills approximately 79,500 people a year (CDC Health  2017). Diabetes is a long lasting disease marked by high blood glucose levels, resulting from the body's inability to produce or use insulin properly (CDC About Diabetes 2017). People with diabetes are at increased risk of serious health complications including vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, amputation of toes, feet or legs, and premature death. (CDC At a Glance 2016). In 2012, diabetes cost the U.S. an estimated $245 billion: $176 billion in direct medical costs and $69 billion in reduced productivity. This is a 41 percent increase from the estimated $174 billion spent on diabetes in 2007 (ADA Economic 2013).  Reducing A1c blood level results by 1 percentage point (eg, from 8.0 percent to 7.0 percent) helps reduce the risk of microvascular complications (eye, kidney and nerve diseases) by as much as 40 percent (CDC Estimates 2011)."

This is a 41 percent increase from the estimated $174 billion spent on diabetes in 2007 (ADA Economic 2013). Diabetes reduces the blood flow to the extremities of the body such as the legs and feet, which make it harder for the body to heal from injuries to those parts of the body. Patients with diabetes are at higher risks of developing serious problems with their feet, toes, and legs which can lead to difficulty walking or even amputation (CDC Living with Diabetes, 2015). According to research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2010 approximately 73,000 adults with diabetes had a leg or foot amputated. Furthermore, amputations in adults with diabetes accounts for 60 percent of amputation of legs and feet, not related to an injury (CDC Living with Diabetes, 2015). Adults 45 years and older with diabetes are 10 times more likely to have an amputation of their leg or foot compared to adults without diabetes (CDC Living with Diabetes, 2015)."

Description: "Breast Cancer Screening. Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancers, accounting for 15 percent of all new cancer diagnoses in the U.S. (Howlader et al, 2016). In 2013, over 3 million women were estimated to be living with breast cancer in the U.S. and it is estimated that 12 percent of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point during their lifetime (Howlader et al, 2016).  While there are other factors that affect a woman's risk of developing breast cancer, advancing age is a primary risk factor. Breast cancer is most frequently diagnosed among women ages 55-64; the median age at diagnosis is 62 years (Howlader et al, 2016). The chance of a woman being diagnosed with breast cancer in a given year increases with age. By age 40, the chances are 1 in 235; by age 50 it becomes 1 in 54; by age 60, it is 1 in 25 (National Business Group on Health, 2011). In the U.S., costs associated with a diagnosis of breast cancer range from $451 to $2,520, factoring in continued testing, multiple office visits and procedures. The total costs related to breast cancer add up to nearly $7 billion per year in the U.S., including $2 billion spent on late-stage treatment (National Business Group on Health, 2011). If breast cancer is detected through mammography screening and diagnosed in its earliest stages, treatment may be less expensive (Feig, 2011)."

Description: "Pneumococcal Vaccination Status for Older Adults. Pneumonia is a common cause of illness and death in the elderly and persons with certain underlying conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, asthma, sickle cell anemia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (NHLBI, 2011). In 1998, an estimated 3,400 adults aged > 65 years died as a result of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (CDC, 2003). Among the 91.5 million US adults aged > 50 years, 29,500 cases of IPD, 502,600 cases of nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 25,400 pneumococcal-related deaths are estimated to occur yearly; annual direct and indirect costs are estimated to total $3.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Pneumococcal disease remains a substantial burden among older US adults, despite increased coverage with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, (PPV23) and indirect benefits afforded by PCV7 vaccination of young children (Weycker, et al., 2011). Vaccination has been found to be effective against bacteremic cases (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.27-0.66) as well as nonbacteremic cases (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.39-0.86). Vaccine effectiveness was highest against bacteremic infections caused by vaccine types (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.09-0.66) (Vila-Corcoles, et al., 2009)."

Description: "Anti-depressant Medication Management. In 2013, over 15 million adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in the past 12 months (National Institute of Mental Health 2013), and depression is estimated to affect nearly a quarter of adults in their lifetime (Burcusa and Iacono 2007). Symptoms of depression include appetite and sleep disturbances, anxiety, irritability and decreased concentration (Charbonneau et al. 2005). The American Psychiatric Association recommends use of antidepressant medication and behavioral therapies, such as psychotherapy, to treat depression (American Psychiatric Association 2010). For the past 50 years, antidepressant medication has proven to be effective especially for patients with more severe symptoms (Fournier et al. 2010). Among patients who initiate antidepressant treatment, one in three discontinues treatment within one month, before the effect of medication can be assessed, and nearly one in two discontinues treatment within three months (Simon 2002). Due to increased risky behaviors for chronic disease (eg, physical inactivity, smoking, excessive drinking and insufficient sleep), evidence has shown that depressive disorders are strongly related to the occurrence of many chronic diseases including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and asthma (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011). Aligning depression quality improvement with methods used in managing other chronic illnesses has been an important step in depression care. Depression management systems have demonstrated improved short- and long-term outcomes of depression severity and persistence, employment retention, functional status and patient satisfaction (Katon et al. 2002; Rost et al. 2001)."

Description: "Prostate Cancer: Avoidance of Overuse of Bone Scan for Staging Low Risk Prostate Cancer Patients. Multiple studies have indicated that a bone scan is not clinically necessary for staging prostate cancer in men with a low (or very low) risk of recurrence and receiving primary therapy. For patients who are categorized as low-risk, bone scans are unlikely to identify their disease. Furthermore, bone scans are not necessary for low-risk patients who have no history or if the clinical examination suggests no bony involvement. Less than 1% of low-risk patients are at risk of metastatic disease. While clinical practice guidelines do not recommend bone scans in low-risk prostate cancer patients, overuse is still common. An analysis of prostate cancer patients in the SEER-Medicare database diagnosed from 2004-2007 found that 43% of patients for whom a bone scan was not recommended received it (Falchook, Hendrix, & Chen, 2015). The analysis also found that the use of bone scans in low-risk patients leads to an annual cost of $4 million dollars to Medicare. The overuse of bone scan imaging for low-risk prostate cancer patients is a concept included on the American Urological Association's (AUA) list in the Choosing Wisely Initiative as a means to promote adherence to evidence-based imaging practices and to reduce health care dollars wasted (AUA, 2013). This measure is intended to promote adherence to evidence-based imaging practices, lessen the financial burden of unnecessary imaging, and ultimately to improve the quality of care for prostate cancer patients in the United States."

Description: "Colorectal Cancer Screening. Colorectal cancer represents 8 percent of all new cancer cases and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In 2017, there were an estimated 135,430 new cases of colorectal cancer and an estimated 50,260 deaths attributed to it. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 4.3 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer at some point during their lifetimes. For most adults, older age is the most important risk factor for colorectal cancer, although being male and black are also associated with higher incidence and mortality. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among people 65 to 74 years old (Howlader et al. 2017). Screening can be effective for finding precancerous lesions (polyps) that could later become malignant, and for detecting early cancers that can be more easily and effectively treated. Precancerous polyps usually take about 10 to 15 years to develop into colorectal cancer, and most can be found and removed before turning into cancer. The five-year relative survival rate for people whose colorectal cancer is found in the early stage before it has spread is about 90 percent (American Cancer Society 2017)."

Description: "Diabetes: Eye Exam. As the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., diabetes kills approximately 79,500 people a year (CDC Health 2017). Diabetes is a long lasting disease marked by high blood glucose levels, resulting from the body's inability to produce or use insulin properly (CDC About Diabetes 2017). People with diabetes are at increased risk of serious health complications including vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, amputation of toes, feet or legs, and premature death. (At a Glance 2016).  In 2012, diabetes cost the U.S. an estimated $245 billion: $176 billion in direct medical costs and $69 billion in reduced productivity. This is a 41 percent increase from the estimated $174 billion spent on diabetes in 2007 (ADA Economic 2013).   Diabetic retinopathy is progressive damage to the small blood vessels in the retina that may result in loss of vision. It is the leading cause of blindness in adults between 20-74 years of age.

Description: "Cataracts: Complications within 30 Days Following Cataract Surgery Requiring Additional Surgical Procedures. In the United States, cataracts affect more than 24 million adults over 40 years. (NEI, 2016) According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), cataract surgery leads to favorable outcomes and improved vision. (AAO, 2016) Although uncommon, complications from cataract surgery do occur and may result in vision loss. (AAO, 2016)  1. Scientific basis for assessing short-term complications following cataract surgery. This short-term outcome of surgery indicator seeks to identify those complications from surgery that can reasonably be attributed to the surgery and surgeon and which reflect situations which - if untreated - generally result in significant avoidable vision loss that would negatively impact patient functioning. Further, it seeks to reduce surgeon burden and enhance accuracy in reporting by focusing on those significant complications that can be assessed from administrative data alone and which can be captured by the care of another physician or the provision of additional, separately coded, post-operative services. Finally, it focuses on patient safety and monitoring for events that, while hopefully uncommon, can signify important issues in the care being provided. For example, the need to reposition or exchange an intraocular lens (IOL) reflects in part 'wrong power' IOL placement, a major patient safety issue. In order to achieve these ends, the indicator excludes patients with other known, pre-operative ocular conditions that could impact the likelihood of developing a complication. Based on the results of the Cataract Appropriateness Project at RAND, other published studies, and one analysis performed on a national MCO data base, the exclusion codes would preserve over 2/3 of all cataract surgery cases for analysis. Thus, this provides a 'clean' indicator that captures care for the large majority of patients undergoing cataract surgery. 2. Evidence for gap in care. The advances in technology and surgical skills over the last 30 years have made cataract surgery much safer and more effective although complications that threaten vision do occur. For example, a study of more than 220,000 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent cataract surgery between 1994 and 2006 found that more than 1,000, or about 0.5%, of patients had at least one severe post-operative complication. These severe complications were defined as endophthalmitis (0.16%), suprachoroidal hemorrhage (0.06%), and retinal detachment (0.26%). (Stein, 2011)  In a review, Taban et al. found a postoperative rate of endophthalmitis of 0.128%. (Taban, 2005) The occurrence of one of these events is associated with a significant potential for vision loss that is otherwise avoidable."

Description: "Cataracts: 20/40 or Better Visual Acuity within 90 Days Following Cataract Surgery. In the United States, cataracts affect more than 24 million adults over 40 years. (NEI, 2016) According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), cataract surgery has a substantial beneficial impact on visual function and on quality of life. (AAO, 2016) 1. Scientific basis for measuring visual acuity outcomes after cataract surgery The only reason to perform cataract surgery (other than for a limited set of medical indications) is to improve a patient's vision and associated functioning. The use of a 20/40 visual acuity threshold is based on several considerations. First, it is the level for unrestricted operation of a motor vehicle in the US. Second, it has been consistently used by the FDA in its assessment for approval of intraocular lens (IOL) and other vision devices. Third, it is the literature standard to denote success in cataract surgery. Fourth, work by West et al in the Salisbury Eye Study suggests that 20/40 is a useful threshold for 50th percentile functioning for several vision-related tasks. Most patients achieve excellent visual acuity after cataract surgery (20/40 or better). This outcome is achieved consistently through careful attention through the accurate measurement of axial length and corneal power and the appropriate selection of an IOL power calculation formula. As such, it reflects the care and diligence with which the surgery is assessed, planned and executed. Failure to achieve this after surgery in eyes without comorbid ocular conditions that would impact the success of the surgery would reflect care that should be assessed for opportunities for improvement. The exclusion of patients with other ocular and systemic conditions known to increase the risk of an adverse outcome reflects the findings of the two published prediction rule papers for cataract surgery outcomes, by Mangione et al and Steinberg et al. In both papers, the presence of comorbid glaucoma and macular degeneration negatively impacted the likelihood of successful outcomes of surgery. Further, as noted in the prior indicator, exclusion of eyes with ocular conditions that could impact the success of the surgery would NOT eliminate the large majority of eyes undergoing surgery while also minimizing the potential adverse selection that might otherwise occur relative to those patients with the most complex situations who might benefit the most from having surgery to maximize their remaining vision. 2. Evidence of a gap in care. Cataract surgery successfully restores vision in the majority of people who have the procedure. Data from a study of 368,256 cataract surgeries show that corrected visual acuity (CDVA) of 0.5 (20/40) or better was achieved in 94.3% and CDVA of 1.0 (20/20) or better was achieved in 61.3% of cases. (Lundstrom, 2013) Additionally, data from a UK multi-center Cataract National Dataset found a postoperative visual acuity of 6/12 (20/40) or better was achieved for 94.7% of eyes with no co-pathologies and in 79.9% of eyes with one or more co-pathologies. (Jaycock, 2009) A rate of 85.5-94.7% of patients achieving a 20/40 or better visual acuity in the context of approximately 3 million cataract surgeries in the US annually would mean that between 160,000 to 435,000 individuals would not achieve a 20/40 or better visual acuity which suggests an opportunity for improvement."

Diabetes is a long lasting disease marked by high blood glucose levels, resulting from the body's inability to produce or use insulin properly (CDC About Diabetes 2017). People with diabetes are at increased risk of serious health complications including vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, amputation of toes, feet or legs, and premature death. (CDC At a Glance 2016).  In 2012, diabetes cost the U.S. an estimated $245 billion: $176 billion in direct medical costs and $69 billion in reduced productivity. This is a 41 percent increase from the estimated $174 billion spent on diabetes in 2007 (ADA Economic 2013). High blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes put them at a higher risk of damaging their kidneys and causing chronic kidney disease, which can lead to kidney failure (CDC Fact Sheet 2017, CDC At a Glance 2016). During 2011-2012 there were 36.5% new cases of chronic kidney disease (stages 1-4) among 297,000 diabetic patients 20 years and older (Murphy 2016). In 2014, diabetes accounted for 44% of 118,000 new cases of end stage renal disease (USRDS 2016)."

Description: "Heart Failure (HF): Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) Therapy for Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD). In the absence of contraindications, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended for all patients with symptoms of heart failure and reduced left ventricular systolic function. ACE inhibitors remain the first choice for inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in chronic heart failure, but ARBs can now be considered a reasonable alternative. Both pharmacologic agents have been shown to decrease the risk of death and hospitalization. Additional benefits of ACE inhibitors include the alleviation of symptoms and the improvement of clinical status and overall sense of well-being of patients with heart failure."

Description: "Follow-Up Care for Children Prescribed ADHD Medication (ADD). Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent behavioral health diseases in children. A National Survey of Children's Health study found that, in 2007, about 9.5% of children 4 to 17 years of age, or about 5.4 million, had a history of ADHD (CDC 2010). Of those 5.4 million children with a history of ADHD, 78% had a current diagnosis of ADHD at the time of the survey (CDC 2010) and 66.3% of those children were taking medication for the disorder (CDC 2010). A similar survey conducted in 2013 found that about 10% of American children age 3-17 have been diagnosed with ADHD (Bloom et al., 2013). ADHD also incurs substantial financial costs due to medical care and work loss costs for patients and families. The annual average direct cost per ADHD patient is $1,574 dollars compared to $541 dollars among similar individuals without ADHD (Swensen et al. 2003). Additionally, children with ADHD add a higher cost to the education system - on average $5,000 each year for each student with ADHD (Robb et al., 2011). There are many symptoms associated with ADHD. Children with ADHD may experience significant functional problems, such as school difficulties, academic underachievement, troublesome relationships with family members and peers and behavioral problems (American Academy of Pediatrics 2000). For instance, recent studies have found that parents whose children have a history of ADHD report significantly more peer problems and a higher rate of non-fatal injuries compared to parents whose children do not have a history of ADHD (Strine et al. 2006; Xiang et al. 2005). Additional studies suggest that there is an increased risk for drug use disorders in adolescents with untreated ADHD (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2010). One of the national objectives of the Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2020 initiative is to increase the proportion of children with mental health problems who receive treatment. Medication treatment has been found to be effective for managing ADHD, but treatment requires careful monitoring by physicians. Studies have shown that psychostimulants are highly effective for 75-90% of children with ADHD by reducing symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention; improving classroom performance and behavior; and promoting increased interaction with teachers, parents and peers (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1999). Some reported adverse effects of stimulant ADHD medications including appetite loss, abdominal pain, headaches, sleep disturbance, decreasing growth velocity, and less commonly, hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms (Wolraich et al. 2011). Therefore, it is important to assess the presence or absence of potential adverse effects before and after a stimulant drug is initiated (Smucker & Hedayat 2001). Monitoring adverse effects from ADHD medication allows physicians to suggest an optimal, alternative treatment. Studies have also shown that treating children with effective medication management can lead to substantially greater improvements in social skills and peer relations compared to children who are not effectively managed (Jensen et al. 2001). Finally, treatments for children with ADHD are frequently not sustained despite the fact that they are at greater risk of significant problems if they discontinue treatment (Wolraich et al. 2011). Effective management mitigates the risk of discontinuing treatment."

There are more deaths, illnesses and disabilities from substance abuse than from any other preventable health condition.  Treatment of medical problems caused by substance use and abuse places a huge burden on the health care system (Schneider Institute 2001). According to a report from the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), an estimated 16.6 million Americans aged 12 or older in 2001 were classified with dependence on or abuse of either alcohol or illicit drugs (7.3 percent of the total population) (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2008). Of these, 2.4 million were classified with dependence on or abuse of both alcohol and illicit drugs, 3.2 million were dependent on or abused illicit drugs but not alcohol, and 11.0 million were dependent on or abused alcohol but not illicit drugs (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2008)."

Description: "Falls: Screening for Future Fall Risk. As the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries for older adults, falls are one of the most common and significant health issues facing people aged 65 years or older (Schneider, Shubert and Harmon 2010). Moreover, the rate of falls increases with age (Dykes et al. 2010). Older adults are five times more likely to be hospitalized for fall-related injuries than any other cause-related injury. It is estimated that one in every three adults over 65 will fall each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015). In those over age 80, the rate of falls increases to fifty percent (Doherty et al. 2009). Falls are also associated with substantial cost and resource use, approaching $30,000 per fall hospitalization (Woolcott et al. 2011). Identifying at-risk patients is the most important part of management, as applying preventive measures in this vulnerable population can have a profound effect on public health (al-Aama 2011). Family physicians have a pivotal role in screening older patients for risk of falls, and applying preventive strategies for patients at risk (al-Aama 2011)."

Description: "Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG): Optic Nerve Evaluation. Changes in the optic nerve are one of two characteristics which currently define progression and thus worsening of glaucoma disease status (the other characteristic is visual field). There is a significant gap in documentation patterns of the optic nerve for both initial and follow-up care (Fremont, 2003), even among specialists (Lee, 2006). Examination of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer provides valuable structural information about glaucomatous optic nerve damage. Visible structural alterations of the optic nerve head or retinal nerve fiber layer and development of peripapillary choroidal atrophy frequently occur before visual field defects can be detected. Careful study of the optic disc neural rim for small hemorrhages is important, since these hemorrhages can precede visual field loss and further optic nerve damage. When initiating therapy, the clinician sets a target range of controlled intraocular pressure (IOP) based on the pretreatment pressure and the presence of optic nerve damage. According to the AAO Glaucoma Preferred Practice Pattern, lowering the pretreatment IOP reduces the risk of developing POAG and slows the progression of POAG to preserve visual function (AAO, 2015)."

Description: "Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Beta-Blocker Therapy-Prior Myocardial Infarction (MI) or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVEF <40%). For patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), beta-blockers are recommended for 3 years after myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. Beta-blockers, particularly carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol which have been shown to reduce risk of death, are recommended indefinitely for patients with CAD and LV systolic dysfunction. These agents have proven efficacy in reducing angina onset and improving the ischemic threshold during exercise. In patients who have suffered an MI, beta-blockers significantly reduce deaths and recurrent MIs (ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS, 2012). Nonadherence to cardioprotective medications is prevalent among outpatients with CAD and can be associated with a broad range of adverse outcomes, including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and the need for revascularization procedures (ACC/AHA, 2002).

Description: "Dementia: Cognitive Assessment. Dementia is often characterized by the gradual onset and continuing cognitive decline in one or more domains including memory, executive function, language, judgment, and spatial abilities. (APA, 2007) Cognitive deterioration represents a major source of morbidity and mortality and poses a significant burden on affected individuals and their caregivers. (NIH, 2010) Although cognitive deterioration follows a different course depending on the type of dementia, significant rates of decline have been reported. For example, one study found that the annual rate of decline for Alzheimer's disease patients was more than four times that of older adults with no cognitive impairment. (Wilson et al., 2010) Nevertheless, measurable cognitive abilities remain throughout the course of dementia. (APA, 2007) Initial and ongoing assessments of cognition are fundamental to the proper management of patients with dementia.

Description: "Chlamydia Screening for Women. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the U.S., resulting in roughly 1.6 million cases each year (CDC 2017). Chlamydia infections are often asymptomatic, but, if left untreated, can lead to serious and irreversible complications (USPSTF 2014, CDC 2017).  Women are particularly vulnerable when infected with chlamydia. Left untreated, chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to chronic pelvic pain or infertility. Pregnant women may also transmit the infection to their infant, potentially resulting in neonatal pneumonia (CDC 2017)."

Too often, antibiotics are prescribed inappropriately, which can lead to antibiotic resistance (when antibiotics can no longer cure bacterial infections). In the United States, at least 2 million antibiotic-resistant illnesses and 23,000 deaths occur each year, at a cost to the U.S. economy of at least $30 billion."

Description: "Weight Assessment and Counseling for Nutrition and Physical Activity for Children and Adolescents. One of the most important developments in pediatrics in the past two decades has been the emergence of a new chronic disease: obesity in childhood and adolescence. The rapidly increasing prevalence of obesity among children is one of the most challenging dilemmas currently facing pediatricians. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from Cycle II (1976-1980) compared with data from Cycle III (1988-1994) documents an increase in the prevalence of obesity in all age, ethnic, and gender groups. NHANES data collected from 1999-2000 revealed a continued increase in the number of obese children. In that data collection, the prevalence of obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 95th percentile) was 10 percent among children 2-5 years of age and 15 percent among children 6-19 years of age. When children at risk for obesity (BMI of 85th-94th percentile) were included, the prevalence increased to 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively. Therefore, >1 of every 4 patients examined by pediatricians either is obese or is considered to be at high risk for developing this challenging health problem (O'Brien et al. 2004). In addition to the growing prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents, the number of overweight children at risk of becoming obese is also of great concern. Evidence suggests that overweight children and adolescents are more likely to become obese as adults. For example, one study found that approximately 80 percent of children who were overweight at age 10-15 years were obese adults at age 25 years (Whitaker et al. 1997). Another study found that 25 percent of obese adults were overweight as children. The latter study also found that if overweight begins before 8 years of age, obesity in adulthood is likely to be more severe (Freedman et al. 2001)."

Description: "Use of High-Risk Medications in the Elderly. Older adults receiving inappropriate medications are more likely to report poorer health status at follow-up, compared to those who receive appropriate medications (Fu, Liu, and Christensen 2004). A study of the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults found that 40 percent of individuals 65 and older filled at least one prescription for a potentially inappropriate medication and 13 percent filled two or more (Fick et al. 2008). While some adverse drug events are not preventable, studies estimate that between 30 and 80 percent of adverse drug events in the elderly are preventable (MacKinnon and Hepler 2003). Reducing the number of inappropriate prescriptions can lead to improved patient safety and significant cost savings.  Conservative estimates of extra costs due to potentially inappropriate medications in the elderly average $7.2 billion a year (Fu et al. 2007). Medication use by older adults will likely increase further as the U.S. population ages, new drugs are developed, and new therapeutic and preventive uses for medications are discovered (Rothberg et al. 2008). The annual direct costs of preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) in the Medicare population have been estimated to exceed $800 million (IOM, 2007). By the year 2030, nearly one in five U.S. residents is expected to be aged 65 years or older; this age group is projected to more than double in number from 38.7 million in 2008 to more than 88.5 million in 2050.  Likewise, the population aged 85 years or older is expected to increase almost four-fold, from 5.4 million to 19 million between 2008 and 2050.  As the elderly population continues to grow, the number of older adults who present with multiple medical conditions for which several medications are prescribed continues to increase, resulting in polypharmacy (Gray and Gardner 2009)."

The current practice of vaccinating all infants against HBV infection and post-exposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin administered at birth to infants of HBV-infected mothers substantially reduces the risk for acquiring HBV infection."

Description: "Depression Remission at Twelve Months. Adults: Depression is a common and treatable mental disorder. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that an estimated 6.6% of the U.S. adult population (14.8 million people) experiences a major depressive disorder during any given 12-month period. Additionally, dysthymia accounts for an additional 3.3 million Americans. In 2006 and 2008, an estimated 9.1% of U.S. adults reported symptoms for current depression (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). Persons with a current diagnosis of depression and a lifetime diagnosis of depression or anxiety were significantly more likely than persons without these conditions to have cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma and obesity and to be a current smoker, to be physically inactive and to drink heavily (Strine, 2008). People who suffer from depression have lower incomes, lower educational attainment and fewer days working each year, leading to seven fewer weeks of work per year, a loss of 20% in potential income and a lifetime loss for each family who has a depressed family member of $300,000 (Smith, 2010).  The cost of depression (lost productivity and increased medical expense) in the United States is $83 billion each year (Greenberg, 2003). Adolescents and Adults: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that during 2009-2012 an estimated 7.6% of the U.S. population aged 12 and over had depression, including 3% of Americans with severe depressive symptoms. Almost 43% of persons with severe depressive symptoms reported serious difficulties in work, home and social activities, yet only 35% reported having contact with a mental health professional in the past year. Depression is associated with higher mortality rates in all age groups. People who are depressed are 30 times more likely to take their own lives than people who are not depressed and five times more likely to abuse drugs. Depression is the leading cause of medical disability for people aged 14 - 44. Depressed people lose 5.6 hours of productive work every week when they are depressed, fifty percent of which is due to absenteeism and short-term disability. Adolescents: In 2014, an estimated 2.8 million adolescents age 12 to 17 in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. This represented 11.4% of the U.S. population. The same survey found that only 41.2 percent of those who had a Major Depressive Episode received treatment in the past year. The 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey of students grades 9 to 12 indicated that during the past 12 months 39.1% (F) and 20.8% (M) indicated feeling sad or hopeless almost every day for at least 2 weeks, planned suicide attempt 16.9% (F) and 10.3% (M), with attempted suicide 10.6% (F) and 5.4% (M). Adolescent-onset depression is associated with chronic depression in adulthood. Many mental health conditions (anxiety, bipolar, depression, eating disorders, and substance abuse) are evident by age 14. The 12-month prevalence of MDEs increased from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014 in adolescents and from 8.8% to 9.6% in young adults (both P < .001). The increase was larger and statistically significant only in the age range of 12 to 20 years. The trends remained significant after adjustment for substance use disorders and sociodemographic factors. Mental health care contacts overall did not change over time; however, the use of specialty mental health providers increased in adolescents and young adults, and the use of prescription medications and inpatient hospitalizations increased in adolescents. In 2015, 9.7% of adolescents in MN who were screened for depression or other mental health conditions, screened positively."

Please note that this process measure for administration of the PHQ-9 or PHQ-9M depression tool, a PROM that is validated for both the assessment and diagnosis of depression as well as for monitoring ongoing outcomes of treatment, is a PAIRED process measure with RELATED measures of depression remission (PHQ-9/PHQ-9M < 5) and depression response (PHQ-9/PHQ-9M is improved by > 50%) at six and twelve months.  To quote a NQF Behavioral Steering Committee member as these measures were initially endorsed 'the best way to avoid being measured is to never give the PHQ-9'.  This process measure allows an understanding of the use of the tool in the target population, promotes frequent and follow-up contact with patients whose score indicates a need for treatment and serves as a catalyst in a collaborative care model for patients with major depression or dysthymia.  It is estimated that up to 90% of patients diagnosed with depression and anxiety are treated solely in primary care (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2011)."

Description: "Adult Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): Suicide Risk Assessment. Research has shown that more than 90% of people who kill themselves have depression or another diagnosable mental or substance abuse disorder. Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the reported suicides in the U.S. each year. The intent of this measure is for a clinician to assess suicide risk at initial intake or at the visit in which depression was diagnosed. As the guidelines state, it is important to assess for additional factors which may increase or decrease suicide risk, such as presence of additional symptoms (eg, psychosis, severe anxiety, hopelessness, severe chronic pain); presence of substance abuse, history and seriousness of previous attempts, particularly, recent suicidal behavior, current stressors and potential protective factors (eg, positive reasons for living, strong social support), family history of suicide or mental illness or recent exposure to suicide, impulsivity and potential for risk to others, including history of violence or violent or homicidal ideas, plans, or intentions, and putting one's affairs in order (eg, giving away possessions, writing a will). In addition, although the measure focuses on the initial visit, it is critical that suicide risk be monitored especially for the 90 days following the initial visit and throughout MDD treatment."

Description: "Ischemic Vascular Disease (IVD): Use of Aspirin or Another Antiplatelet. Cardiovascular disease, including stroke, is the leading cause of death in the United States. More than 92.1 million American adults have one or more types of cardiovascular disease. Specifically, more than 16 million adults (20 years and older) have coronary heart disease (CHD), over 8 million adults have angina, more than 7 million adults have had a myocardial infarction (MI), over 7 million adults have had a stroke, and nearly 7 million adults 40 years of age and older have peripheral artery disease (Benjamin et al., 2017). It is estimated that by 2030 more than 44 percent of Americans will have a form of cardiovascular disease (Heidenreich et al., 2011). In 2011, the total cost of cardiovascular disease and stroke in the United States was estimated to be $320 billion. This total includes direct costs such as the cost of physicians and other health professionals, hospital services, prescribed medications and home health care, as well as indirect costs due to loss of productivity from premature mortality (Benjamin et al., 2017). By 2030, direct medical costs for cardiovascular disease are projected to increase to nearly $918 billion (Heidenreich, 2011). Antiplatelet medications, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, are drugs that inhibit platelets from clumping together and forming clots. Their use in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is well established.  In patients who are at high risk because they already have occlusive cardiovascular disease, long-term antiplatelet therapy reduces the yearly risk of serious vascular events (MI, stroke, death) by about twenty-five percent (Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration, 1994; 2002; 2009). A more recent systematic review of the literature confirmed the benefits of antiplatelet therapy in reducing death from cardiovascular causes, MI, or stroke (Cheng, 2013). Antiplatelet agents also have a beneficial effect in reducing all-cause mortality and fatal cardiovascular events in patients with peripheral arterial disease (Wong et al., 2011)."

Description: "Controlling High Blood Pressure. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a very common and dangerous condition that increases risk for heart disease and stroke, two of the leading causes of death for Americans (Farley et al., 2010). Compared with other dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors, high blood pressure is the leading cause of death in women and the second-leading cause of death in men, behind smoking (Danaei et al., 2011). Approximately 1 in 3 U.S. adults, or about 70 million people, have high blood pressure but only about half (52%) of these people have their high blood pressure under control. Additionally, data from NHANES 2011 to 2012 found that 17.2% of U.S. adults are not aware they have hypertension (Nwankwo et al., 2013). Projections show that by 2030, approximately 41.4% of US adults will have hypertension, an increase of 8.4% from 2012 estimates (Heidenreich et al., 2011). The estimated direct and indirect cost of high blood pressure for 2011 is $46.4 billion. This total includes direct costs such as the cost of physicians and other health professionals, hospital services, prescribed medications and home health care, as well as indirect costs due to loss of productivity from premature mortality (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). Projections show that by 2030, the total cost of high blood pressure could increase to an estimated $274 billion (Heidenreich et al., 2011). Better control of blood pressure has been shown to significantly reduce the probability that undesirable and costly outcomes will occur. In clinical trials, antihypertensive therapy has been associated with reductions in stroke incidence (35-40%), myocardial infarction (20-25%) and heart failure (>50%) (Chobanian et al., 2003). Thus, the relationship between the measure (control of hypertension) and the long-term clinical outcomes listed is well established."

Description: "Diabetic Retinopathy: Documentation of Presence or Absence of Macular Edema and Level of Severity of Retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of new cases of legal blindness among working-age Americans and represents a leading cause of blindness in this age group worldwide. (Klein, 2007). In 2005-2008, the estimated prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy was 28.5 percent among persons with diabetes aged 40 years and older (Zhang, 2010). Approximately 1.5% of adults with diabetes had proliferative diabetic retinopathy and 2.7% had clinically significant macular edema (Zhang, 2010). Several level 1 RCT studies demonstrate the ability of timely treatment to reduce the rate and severity of vision loss from diabetes (Diabetic Retinopathy Study -- DRS, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study -- ETDRS). Necessary examination prerequisites to applying the study results are that the presence and severity of both peripheral diabetic retinopathy and macular edema be accurately documented. In the RAND chronic disease quality project, while administrative data indicated that roughly half of the patients had an eye exam in the recommended time period, chart review data indicated that only 19% had documented evidence of a dilated examination (McGlynn, 2003). Thus, ensuring timely treatment that could prevent 95% of the blindness due to diabetes requires the performance and documentation of key examination parameters. The documented level of severity of retinopathy and the documented presence or absence of macular edema assists with the on-going plan of care for the patient with diabetic retinopathy."

Description: "Bipolar Disorder and Major Depression: Appraisal for alcohol or chemical substance use. Individuals with bipolar disorder or major depression have high rates of co-morbid substance abuse and should be screened for substance use disorders. Between 40-70% of people with bipolar disorder have a history of substance use disorder. A current or past co-morbid substance use disorder may lead to worse outcomes for bipolar disorders, including more symptoms, more suicide attempts, longer episodes and lower quality of life. Substance abuse may obscure or exacerbate mood swings that have no other apparent external cause. Substance abuse may also precipitate mood episodes or be used by patients to self-treat in an attempt to improve the symptoms of episodes. Patients suffering from major depressive disorder with co-morbid addiction are more likely to require hospitalization, more likely to attempt suicide and less likely to comply with treatment than are patients with these disorders of similar severity not complicated by these factors."

Description: "Child and Adolescent Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): Suicide Risk Assessment. Research has shown that patients with major depressive disorder are at a high risk for suicide attempts and completion - among the most significant and devastating sequelae of the disease. Suicide risk is a critical consideration in children and adolescents with MDD and an important aspect of care that should be assessed at each visit and subsequently managed to minimize that risk. Additionally, the importance of the assessments is underscored by research that indicates that many individuals who die by suicide do make contact with primary care providers and mental health services beforehand. More specifically, approximately 15% of suicide victims aged 35 years or younger had seen a mental health professional within 1 month of suicide while approximately 23% had seen a primary care provider within 1 month of suicide."

Description: "Intensive Care Unit Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis (VTE-2). Approximately two-thirds of cases of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) or Pulmonary Emboli (PE) are associated with recent hospitalization. This is consistent with the 2001 report by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Shojania, et al., 2001). AHRQ reports that 'the appropriate application of effective preventive measures in hospitals has major potential for improving patient safety, by reducing the incidence of VTE.' Almost all hospitalized patients have at least one risk factor for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE), and approximately 40% have three or more risk factors. Without thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of objectively confirmed, hospital-acquired DVT is approximately 10% to 40% among medical or general surgical patients and 40% to 60% following major orthopedic surgery (Geerts et al., 2008). Commonly, criteria for admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) itself, puts patient's at an increased risk for developing VTE, and subsequent increased risk of morbidity from PE. Some risk factors are related to the acute illness present that allowed for the admission to the ICU unit, and some risk factors may be acquired during the ICU admission due to subsequent medical treatments, for example limitations of mobility, presence of central venous lines or mechanical ventilation and subsequent pharmacological paralysis.  Reports of DVT in the population of ICU patients vary in relation to the acuity of the illness in this population. DVT in ICU patients diagnosed with routine venography or Doppler ultrasound found ranges between 10% to 100%. Five studies prospectively screened patients who were not receiving thromboprophylaxis during their ICU stays. The rates of DVT using Fibrinogen Uptake Test, Doppler Ultrasound or venography ranged from 13 to 31% (Geerts et al., 2008).  It is essential for all ICUs to assess each patient upon admission to the ICU unit, a change in level of status, for the need for VTE prophylaxis due to the above increased development of risk factors (Geerts, et al., 2004). Some select surgeries have previously been monitored in the Surgical Care Improvement Project; since performance on these surgeries has achieved very high levels, they are not included in this measure."

Description: "Preventive Care and Screening: Screening for High Blood Pressure and Follow-Up Documented. Hypertension is a prevalent condition that affects approximately 66.9 million people in the United States. It is estimated that about 20-40% of the adult population has hypertension; the majority of people over age 65 have a hypertension diagnosis (Appleton SL, et. al., 2012 and Luehr D, et. al., 2012). Winter (2013) noted that 1 in 3 American adults have hypertension and the lifetime risk of developing hypertension is 90% (Winter KH, et. al., 2013). The African American population or non-Hispanic Blacks, the elderly, diabetics and those with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and renal disease. Non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest prevalence at 38.6% (Winter KH, et. al., 2013). Hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure, stroke and dementia (Luehr D, et. al., 2012).  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy. Garrison (2013) stated that in 2007, 42 million ambulatory visits were attributed to hypertension (Garrison GM and Oberhelman S, 2013). It also has the highest utilization of prescription drugs. Numerous resources and treatment options are available, yet only about 40-50% of the hypertensive patients have their blood pressure under control (<140/90) (Appleton SL, et. al., 2012, Luehr D, et. al., 2012). In addition to medication non-compliance, poor outcomes are also attributed to poor adherence to lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol intake. Many adults find it difficult to continue medications and lifestyle changes when they are asymptomatic. Symptoms of elevated blood pressure usually do not occur until secondary problems arise such as with vascular diseases (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and renal insufficiency) (Luehr D, et. al., 2012). Appropriate follow-up after blood pressure measurement is a pivotal component in preventing the progression of hypertension and the development of heart disease. Detection of marginally or fully elevated blood pressure by a specialty clinician warrants referral to a provider familiar with the management of hypertension and prehypertension.  The 2010 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk in Asymptomatic Adults continues to support using a global risk score such as the Framingham Risk Score, to assess risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in all asymptomatic adults (Greenland P, et. al., 2010).  Lifestyle modifications have demonstrated effectiveness in lowering blood pressure (JNC 7, 2003).  The synergistic effect of several lifestyle modifications results in greater benefits than a single modification alone. Baseline diagnostic/laboratory testing establishes if a co-existing underlying condition is the etiology of hypertension and evaluates if end organ damage from hypertension has already occurred. Landmark trials such as ALLHAT have repeatedly proven the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy to control blood pressure and reduce the complications of hypertension.  Follow-up intervals based on blood pressure control have been established by the JNC 7 and the USPSTF."

Description: "Appropriate Use of DXA Scans in Women Under 65 Years Who Do Not Meet the Risk Factor Profile for Osteoporotic Fracture. This measure is expected to increase recording of patient risk for fracture data and decrease the amount of inappropriate DXA scans. Current osteoporosis guidelines underscore the importance of screening women for osteoporosis if they are 1) 65 years or older or 2) younger than 65 if they have a fracture risk 'equal to or greater than that of a 65-year-old white woman who has no additional risk factors.' Clinical information, such as age, body mass index (BMI), parental fracture history, and tobacco and alcohol use, can be used to determine a woman's fracture risk (USPSTF, 2011). Additionally, there are potentially avoidable harms associated with screening for osteoporosis in general, including exposure to radiation, false positive exams, and resulting side effects from unnecessary osteoporosis medications, which add costs to an already burdened health care system (Lim, 2009)."

Description: "Home Management Plan of Care (HMPC) Document Given to Patient/Caregiver (CAC-3). Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and a major cause of morbidity and health care costs nationally (Adams, et al, 2001). In 2005, 5.2% of children with asthma had at least one asthma attack in the previous year (3.8 million children). Nearly two of every three children who currently have asthma had at least one attack in the past 12 months. Chronic asthma in children can account for an annual loss of more than 14 million school days per year, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation (Asthma Facts and Figures). It is clear from multiple sources of evidence including the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Guidelines that actual self-management of asthma by the patient or caregiver leads to more positive outcomes. Appropriate self-management is completely reliant upon patient education. Patient education is more effective when it aims at training self-management skills that will alter behavior (Norris, et al, 2001). NHLBI notes that review of asthma management by expert clinicians is necessary but not sufficient to improve outcomes. Active learning, participating and verbalization of understanding are all strategies that a healthcare organization must incorporate with parents or caregivers of asthmatic children in order for them to understand and make the appropriate changes that can impact the disease in the child in question. Education programs have been effective in improving lung function, feelings of self-esteem, and consequently decreased missed days of school in children and adolescents (Phipatanakul, 2004). Acute hospitalization follow up is imperative to a successful discharge from the hospital, providing the caretaker with the resource information needed to contact the follow up facility, medical office or clinic setting (Schatz, et al, 2009). Environmental control consists of removal of asthma triggers from the environment. Multiple studies support the positive correlation of household maintenance factors such as control of cockroach dust, and the number of acute asthma attacks in asthmatic children (McConnell, et al, 2005 and Eggleston, et al, 2005). Evidence from Carter et al, (2001) supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH) grant found specifically that reduction in triggers such as household conditions i.e. dust mites, cockroach, cats and presence of molds and fungus, resulted in a decrease in acute care visits and an overall positive outcome of children. Rescue action education related to early recognition of symptoms and proper action to control incidence of asthma attacks is noted to have positive outcomes for asthmatic children (Ducharme and Bhogal, 2008)."

Description: "Preventive Care and Screening: Screening for Depression and Follow-Up Plan. Depression is a serious medical illness associated with higher rates of chronic disease, increased health care utilization, and impaired functioning (Pratt, Brody 2014). 2014 U.S. survey data indicate that 2.8 million (11.4 percent) adolescents aged 12 to 17 had a major depressive episode (MDE) in the past year and that 15.7 million (6.6 percent) adults aged 18 or older had at least one MDE in the past year, with 10.2 million adults (4.3 percent) having one MDE with severe impairment in the past year (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015). Data indicate that severity of depressive symptoms factor into having difficulty with work, home, or social activities. For example, as the severity of depressive symptoms increased, rates of having difficulty with work, home, or social activities related to depressive symptoms increased. For those twelve and older with mild depressive symptoms, 45.7% reported difficulty with activities and those with severe depressive symptoms, 88.0% reported difficulty (Pratt & Brody, 2014). Children and teens with major depressive disorder (MDD) has been found to have difficulty carrying out their daily activities, relating to others, and growing up healthy with an increased risk of suicide (Siu and USPSTF, 2016). Additionally, among pregnant women, especially during the perinatal period, depression and other mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders, can have devastating effects on women, infants, and families. Maternal suicide rates rise over hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders as a cause of maternal mortality (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015). Negative outcomes associated with depression make it crucial to screen in order to identify and treat depression in its early stages. While Primary Care Providers (PCPs) serve as the first line of defense in the detection of depression, studies show that PCPs fail to recognize up to 50% of depressed patients (Borner, 2010, p. 948). 'Coyle et al. (2003), suggested that the picture is more grim for adolescents, and that more than 70% of children and adolescents suffering from serious mood disorders go unrecognized or inadequately treated' (Borner, 2010, p. 948). 'In nationally representative U.S. surveys, about 8% of adolescents reported having major depression in the past year. Only 36% to 44% of children and adolescents with depression receive treatment, suggesting that the majority of depressed youth are undiagnosed and untreated' (Sui, A. and USPSTF, 2016). Evidence supports that screening for depression in pregnant and postpartum women is of moderate net benefit and treatment options for positive depression screening should be available for patients twelve and older including pregnant and postpartum women. If preventing negative patient outcomes is not enough, the substantial economic burden of depression for individuals and society alike makes a case for screening for depression on a regular basis. Depression imposes economic burden through direct and indirect costs. 'In the United States, an estimated $22.8 billion was spent on depression treatment in 2009, and lost productivity cost an additional estimated $23 billion in 2011' (Sui, A. and USPSTF, 2016). This measure seeks to align with clinical guideline recommendations as well as the Healthy People 2020 recommendation for routine screening for mental health problems as a part of primary care for both children and adults (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2014) and  makes an important contribution to the quality domain of community and population health."

Description: "Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients (ED-3). In recent times, EDs have experienced significant overcrowding. Although once only a problem in large, urban, teaching hospitals, the phenomenon has spread to other suburban and rural healthcare organizations. According to a 2002 national U.S. survey, more than 90 percent of large hospitals report EDs operating 'at' or 'over' capacity. Overcrowding and heavy emergency resource demand have led to a number of problems, including ambulance refusals, prolonged patient waiting times, increased suffering for those who wait, rushed and unpleasant treatment environments, and potentially poor patient outcomes. Approximately one third of hospitals in the U.S. report increases in ambulance diversion in a given year, whereas up to half report crowded conditions in the ED. In a recent national survey, 40 percent of hospital leaders viewed ED crowding as a symptom of workforce shortages. ED crowding may result in delays in the administration of medication such as antibiotics for pneumonia and has been associated with perceptions of compromised emergency care. For patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, long ED stays were associated with decreased use of guideline-recommended therapies and a higher risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. When EDs are overwhelmed, their ability to respond to community emergencies and disasters may be compromised."

Description: "Statin Therapy for the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease. 'Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, causing approximately 1 of every 7 deaths in the United States in 2011. In 2011, stroke caused approximately 1 of every 20 deaths in the United States and the estimated annual costs for CVD and stroke were $320.1 billion, including $195.6 billion in direct costs (hospital services, physicians and other professionals, prescribed medications, home health care, and other medical durables) and $124.5 billion in indirect costs from lost future productivity (cardiovascular and stroke premature deaths). CVD costs more than any other diagnostic group' (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). Data collected between 2009 and 2012 indicates that more than 100 million U.S. adults, 20 years or older, had total cholesterol levels equal to 200 mg/dL or more, while almost 31 million had levels 240 mg/dL or more (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). Elevated blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for CVD and statin therapy has been associated with a reduced risk of CVD. Numerous randomized trials have demonstrated that treatment with a statin reduces LDL-C, and reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events by approximately 20 percent (Ference, 2015). In 2013, guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults were published (see Stone et al., 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults: a Report of the American College of Cardiology [ACC]/American Heart Association [AHA] Task Force on Practice Guidelines). This guideline was published by an Expert Panel, which synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials to identify people most likely to benefit from cholesterol-lowering therapy. The ACC/AHA Guideline recommendations are intended to provide a strong evidence-based foundation for the treatment of blood cholesterol for the primary and secondary prevention and treatment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) in adult men and women (21 years of age or older). The document concludes the addition of statin therapy reduces the risk of ASCVD among high-risk individuals, defined as follows: individuals with clinical ASCVD, with LDL-C >= 190 mg/dL, or with diabetes and LDL-C 70-189 mg/dL (Stone et al., 2013). However, one study that surveyed U.S. cardiovascular practices participating in the PINNACLE registry, found that 32.4 percent of patients with an indication for statins under the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines were not currently receiving them (Maddox et al., 2014). Although, systematic evidence review found that statins are safe drugs with low incidence of conditions or diseases attributable to statin use (Law et al., 2006). Overall, the Statin Safety Expert Panel that participated in an NLA Statin Safety Task Force meeting in October 2013 reaffirms the general safety of statin therapy. The panel members concluded that for most patients requiring statin therapy, the potential benefits of statin therapy outweigh the potential risks. In general terms, the benefits of statins to prevent non-fatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, stroke, and CVD mortality, far outweighs any potential harm related to the drug (Jacobson, 2014)."

Description: "HIV Screening. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a communicable infection that leads to a progressive disease with a long asymptomatic period. Approximately 50,000 persons in the United States are newly infected with HIV each year (Prejean 2011). Without treatment, most persons develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) within 10 years of HIV infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) delays this progression and increases the length of survival, but it is most effective when initiated during the asymptomatic phase. It is estimated that on average an HIV-infected person aged 25 years who receives high quality health care will live an additional 39 years (Lohse 2007). DHHS Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents recommends antiretroviral therapy for all HIV-infected individuals to reduce the risk of disease progression (regardless of CD4 cell count at diagnosis) (Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents, 2017). CDC estimates that almost 16% of the 1.1 million adults and adolescents living with HIV infection in the United States are unaware of their infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2013). Among persons diagnosed with HIV in 2011, one quarter were diagnosed with Stage 3 HIV (AIDS) at the time of HIV diagnosis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010). Median CD4 count at diagnosis is less than 350 cells/mm3 (Althoff 2010). HIV screening identifies infected persons who were previously unaware of their infection, which enables them to seek medical and social services that can improve their health and the quality and length of their lives. Additionally, using ART with high levels of medication adherence has been shown to substantially reduce risk for HIV transmission (Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents, 2017). Based on the National Health Interview Survey, fewer than half of persons 18 and older reported ever having been tested for HIV as of 2010 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2014)."

Description: "Closing the Referral Loop: Receipt of Specialist Report. Problems in the outpatient referral and consultation process have been documented, including lack of timeliness of information and inadequate provision of information between the specialist and the requesting physician (Gandhi, 2000; Forrest, 2000; Stille, 2005). In a study of physician satisfaction with the outpatient referral process, Gandhi et al. (2000) found that 68% of specialists reported receiving no information from the primary care provider prior to referral visits, and 25% of primary care providers had still not received any information from specialists 4 weeks after referral visits. In another study of 963 referrals (Forrest, 2000), pediatricians scheduled appointments with specialists for only 39% and sent patient information to the specialists in only 51% of the time. In a 2006 report to Congress, MedPAC found that care coordination programs improved quality of care for patients, reduced hospitalizations, and improved adherence to evidence-based care guidelines, especially among patients with diabetes and CHD. Associations with cost-savings were less clear; this was attributed to how well the intervention group was chosen and defined, as well as the intervention put in place. Additionally, cost-savings were usually calculated in the short-term, while some argue that the greatest cost-savings accrue over time (MedPAC, 2006). Improved mechanisms for information exchange could facilitate communication between providers, whether for time-limited referrals or consultations, on-going co-management, or during care transitions. For example, a study by Branger et al. (1999) found that an electronic communication network that linked the computer-based patient records of physicians who had shared care of patients with diabetes significantly increased frequency of communications between physicians and availability of important clinical data. There was a 3-fold increase in the likelihood that the specialist provided written communication of results if the primary care physician scheduled appointments and sent patient information to the specialist (Forrest, 2000). Care coordination is a focal point in the current health care reform and our nation's ambulatory health information technology (HIT) framework. The National Priorities Partnership recently highlighted care coordination as one of the most critical areas for development of quality measurement and improvement (NPP, 2008)."

Description: "HIV/AIDS: Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia (PCP) Prophylaxis. Although advances in the management of HIV and AIDS diseases have been made, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) remains an important complication and cause of morbidity.  Without PCP prophylaxis, patients with HIV/AIDS are at increased risk of developing PCP, especially when CD4 cell counts falls to 200 cells/mm3-250 cells/mm3 (Kaplan, 1998; Phair, 1990).  PCP prophylaxis is very effective and has been demonstrated to prolong life. Data from Kaiser Permanente suggests that there is a gap in care related to the prescription of PCP prophylaxis for patients with HIV.  According to 2005-2006 data from Kaiser Permanente California (both Northern and Southern), Georgia, and Oregon, only 71% of HIV-infected persons with a CD4<200 cells/mm3 received PCP prophylaxis (personal communication, 2007)."

Men undergoing prolonged androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) incur bone loss at a rate higher than menopausal women (Guise, 2007). In preserving bone health, the goal is to prevent or treat osteopenia/osteoporosis for the patient on ADT and to prevent or delay skeletal related events. The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommendations including a baseline assessment of bone density with a DEXA scan and daily calcium and Vitamin D supplementation (Watts, 2012). The DEXA scan is the gold standard for bone density screening. Men at risk for adverse bone consequences from chronic ADT do not always receive care according to evidence based guidelines. These findings call for improved processes that standardize evidence based practice including baseline and follow up bone density assessment (Watts, 2012)."

Description: "Hypertension: Improvement in Blood Pressure. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a very common and dangerous condition that increases risk for heart disease and stroke, two of the leading causes of death for Americans (Farley et al., 2010). Compared with other dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors, high blood pressure is the leading cause of death in women and the second-leading cause of death in men, behind smoking (Danaei et al., 2011). Approximately 1 in 3 U.S. adults, or about 70 million people, have high blood pressure but only about half (52%) of these people have their high blood pressure under control. Additionally, data from NHANES 2011 to 2012 found that 17.2% of U.S. adults are not aware they have hypertension (Nwankwo et al., 2013). Projections show that by 2030, approximately 41.4% of US adults will have hypertension, an increase of 8.4% from 2012 estimates (Heidenreich et al., 2011). The estimated direct and indirect cost of high blood pressure for 2011 is $46.4 billion. This total includes direct costs such as the cost of physicians and other health professionals, hospital services, prescribed medications and home health care, as well as indirect costs due to loss of productivity from premature mortality (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). Projections show that by 2030, the total cost of high blood pressure could increase to an estimated $274 billion (Heidenreich et al., 2011). Better control of blood pressure has been shown to significantly reduce the probability that undesirable and costly outcomes will occur. In clinical trials, antihypertensive therapy has been associated with reductions in stroke incidence (35-40%), myocardial infarction (20-25%) and heart failure (>50%) (Chobanian et al., 2003). Thus, the relationship between the measure (control of hypertension) and the long-term clinical outcomes listed is well established."

Description: "Documentation of Current Medications in the Medical Record. Prescription medication use is common among adults of all ages, particularly older adults and adults with chronic conditions. On average, 81% of adults in the U.S. are taking at least one medication (prescription or nonprescription, vitamin/mineral, herbal/natural supplement); 29% are taking five or more. Older adults are the biggest consumers of medications with 17-19% of people 65 and older taking at least ten medications in a given week (Qato et al., 2008). In this context, maintaining an accurate and complete medication list has proven to be a challenging documentation endeavor for various health care provider settings. While most of outpatient encounters (2/3) result in providers prescribing at least one medication, hospitals have been the focus of medication safety efforts (Stock et al., 2009). Nassaralla et al. (2007) caution that this is at odds with the current trend, where patients with chronic illnesses are increasingly being treated in the outpatient setting and require careful monitoring of multiple medications. Additionally Nassaralla et al. (2007) reveal that it is in fact in outpatient settings where more fatal adverse drug events (ADE) occur when these are compared to those occurring in hospitals (1 of 131 outpatient deaths compared to 1 in 854 inpatient deaths). In the outpatient setting, adverse drug events (ADEs) occur 25% of the time and over one-third of these are considered preventable (Tache et al., 2011). Particularly vulnerable are patients over 65 years, with evidence suggesting that the rate of ADEs per 10,000 person per year increases with age; 25-44 years old at 1.3; 45-64 at 2.2, and 65 + at 3.8 (Sarkar et al., 2011). Another vulnerable group are chronically ill individuals. These population groups are more likely to experience ADEs and subsequent hospitalization. A multiplicity of providers and inadequate care coordination among them has been identified as barriers to collecting complete and reliable medication records. Data indicate that reconciliation and documentation continues to be poorly executed with discrepancies occurring in 92% (74 of 80 patients) of medication lists among admittance to the emergency room. Of 80 patients included in the study, the home medications were re ordered for 65% of patients on their admission and of the 65% the majority (29%) had a change in their dosing interval, while 23% had a change in their route of administration, and 13% had a change in dose. A total of 361 medication discrepancies, or the difference between the medications patients were taking before admission and those listed in there admission orders, were identified in at least 74 patients (Poornima et al., 2015). The study found that 'Through an appropriate reconciliation programme, around 80% of errors relating to medication and the potential harm caused by these errors could be reduced.' (Poornima et al., 2015, p. 243). Documentation of current medications in the medical record facilitates the process of medication review and reconciliation by the provider, which are necessary for reducing ADEs and promoting medication safety. The need for provider to provider coordination regarding medication records, and the existing gap in implementation, is highlighted in the American Medical Association's (AMA) Physician's Role in Medication Reconciliation (2007), which states that 'critical patient information, including medical and medication histories, current medications the patient is receiving and taking, and sources of medications, is essential to the delivery of safe medical care. However, interruptions in the continuity of care and information gaps in patient health records are common and significantly affect patient outcomes' (American Medical Association, 2007, p. 7). This is because clinical decisions based on information that is incomplete and/or inaccurate are likely to lead to medication error and ADEs. Weeks et al. (2010) noted similar barriers and identified the utilization of health information technology as an opportunity for facilitating the creation of universal medication lists. One 2015 meta-analysis showed an association between EHR documentation with an overall RR of 0.46 (95% CI = 0.38 to 0.55; P < 0.001) and ADEs with an overall RR of 0.66 (95% CI = 0.44 to 0.99; P = 0.045). This meta-analysis provides evidence that the use of the EHR can improve the quality of healthcare delivered to patients by reducing medication errors and ADEs (Campanella et al., 2016)."

Description: "Preventive Care and Screening: Body Mass Index (BMI) Screening and Follow-Up Plan. BMI Above Normal Parameters. Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial disease with complex psychological, environmental (social and cultural), genetic, physiologic, metabolic and behavioral causes and consequences. The prevalence of overweight and obese people is increasing worldwide at an alarming rate in both developing and developed countries. Environmental and behavioral changes brought about by economic development, modernization and urbanization have been linked to the rise in global obesity. The health consequences are becoming apparent (ICSI 2013. p.6). Hales et al (2017), report that the prevalence of obesity among adults and youth in the United States was 39.8% and 18.5% respectively, from 2015-2016. They note that obesity prevalence was higher among adults in the 40-59 age bracket than those in the 20-39 age bracket, for both men and women. Hales et al. (2017) also disaggregated the data according to ethnicity and noted that obesity prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults and youth when compared with other races ethnicities. While obesity prevalence was lower among non-Hispanic Asian men and women, obesity prevalence among men, was comparable between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white men. Obesity prevalence was higher among Hispanic men compared with non-Hispanic black men. While the prevalence among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women was comparable, the prevalence for both groups was higher than that of non-Hispanic white women. Most notably, Hales et al (2017), report that the prevalence of obesity in the United States remains higher than the Healthy People 2020 goals of 14.5% among youth and 30.5% among adults. More than a third of U.S. adults have a body mass index [BMI] >= 30 kg/m2; substantially at increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Flegal et al., 2012; Ogden et al., 2014). Behavioral weight management treatment has been identified as an effective first-line treatment for obesity with an average initial weight loss of 8-10%. This percentage weight loss is associated with a significant risk reduction for diabetes and CVD (Butryn et al., 2011; Wadden et al., 2012). Despite the availability of effective interventions, two-thirds of obese U.S. patients were not offered or referred to weight management treatment during their primary care visit between 2005 and 2006, (Ma et al., 2009). In addition, the rate of weight management counseling in primary care significantly decreased by 10%  (40% to 30%) between 1995-1996 and 2007-2008 (Kraschnewski et al., 2013). This suggests that the availability of evidence based clinical guidelines since 2008 obesity management in primary care remains suboptimal (Fitzpatrick S.L., Stevens, V. J., 2017, pp 128-132). BMI continues to be a common and reasonably reliable measurement to identify overweight and obese adults who may be at an increased risk for future morbidity. Although good quality evidence supports obtaining a BMI, it is important to recognize it is not a perfect measurement. BMI is not a direct measure of adiposity and as a consequence it can over- or underestimate adiposity. BMI is a derived value that correlates well with total body fat and markers of secondary complications, eg, hypertension and dyslipidemia (Barlow, 2007). In contrast with waist circumference, BMI and its associated disease and mortality risk appear to vary among ethnic subgroups. Female African American populations appear to have the lowest mortality risk at a BMI of 26.2-28.5 kg/m2 and 27.1-30.2 kg/m2 for women and men, respectively. In contrast, Asian populations may experience lowest mortality rates starting at a BMI of 23 to 24 kg/m2. The correlation between BMI and diabetes risk also varies by ethnicity (LeBlanc, 2011. p.2-3) Screening for BMI and follow-up therefore is critical to closing this gap and contributes to quality goals of population health and cost reduction. However, due to concerns for other underlying conditions (such as bone health) or nutrition related deficiencies providers are cautioned to use clinical judgment and  take these into account when considering weight management programs for overweight patients, especially the elderly (NHLBI Obesity Education Initiative, 1998, p. 91). BMI below Normal Parameters: On the other end of the body weight spectrum is underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), which is equally detrimental to population health. When compared to normal weight individuals(BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2), underweight individuals have significantly higher death rates with a Hazard Ratio of 2.27 and  95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.78, 2.90 (Borrell & Lalitha (2014).  Poor nutrition or underlying health conditions can result in underweight (Fryer & Ogden, 2012). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) results from the 2007-2010 indicate that women are more likely to be underweight than men (2012). Therefore patients should be equally screened for underweight and followed up with nutritional counselling to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with underweight."

Description: "Anticoagulation Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter (STK-03). Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a common arrhythmia and an important risk factor for stroke. It is one of several conditions and lifestyle factors that have been identified as risk factors for stroke. It has been estimated that over 2 million adults in the United States have NVAF. While the median age of patients with atrial fibrillation is 75 years, the incidence increases with advancing age. For example, The Framingham Heart Study noted a dramatic increase in stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation with advancing age, from 1.5% for those 50 to 59 years of age to 23.5% for those 80 to 89 years of age. Furthermore, a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are among a limited number of predictors of high stroke risk within the population of patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, much emphasis has been placed on identifying methods for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke as well as preventing first stroke. Prevention strategies focus on the modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, and atrial fibrillation. Analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of warfarin in the primary prevention of thromboembolic stroke, found the relative risk of thromboembolic stroke was reduced by 68% for atrial fibrillation patients treated with warfarin. The administration of anticoagulation therapy, unless there are contraindications, is an established effective strategy in preventing recurrent stroke in high stroke risk-atrial fibrillation patients with TIA or prior stroke."

Description: "Antithrombotic Therapy By End of Hospital Day 2 (STK-05). The effectiveness of antithrombotic agents in reducing stroke mortality, stroke-related morbidity and recurrence rates has been studied in several large clinical trials. While the use of these agents for patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks continues to be the subject of study, substantial evidence is available from completed studies. Data at this time suggest that antithrombotic therapy should be administered within 2 days of symptom onset in acute ischemic stroke patients to reduce stroke mortality and morbidity as long as no contraindications exist. Anticoagulants at doses to prevent venous thromboembolism are insufficient antithrombotic therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA."

Description: "Maternal Depression Screening. Maternal depression is a common condition with potentially serious and far-reaching consequences. Rates of depression for pregnant and/or postpartum women range from 12-15%, with postpartum depression rates in some U.S. areas estimated to be as high as 20% (Ko et al. 2017; Gaynes et al. 2005; Bennett et al. 2004). Depression has significant consequences for women, their infants and families. Women with untreated depression during pregnancy are at risk of developing severe postpartum depression and suicidality, and of delivering premature or low birthweight babies (Chan et al. 2014). Postpartum depression hinders infant attachment and bonding and can lead to developmental disorders that last into adolescence (Field 2010; Kingston et al. 2012; Dawson et al. 1999). During infancy, important caregiving activities such as breastfeeding, sleep, adherence to well-child visits and vaccine schedules can be compromised in depressed mothers (Kingston et al. 2012; Gregory et al. 2015; Minkovitz et al. 2005). Clinical guidelines recommend that maternal screenings for depression should occur where there are adequate systems in place (Sui et al. 2016; ACOG 2015; Yonkers et al. 2009). Adequate systems in place means having the appropriate systems and clinical staff to ensure that patients are screened and, if screened positive, are appropriately diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care or referred to a setting that can provide the necessary care (Sui et al. 2016). Guidelines also recommend that providers maintain regular follow-up with patients diagnosed with depression and use a standardized tool to track symptoms (Mitchell et al. 2013). Standardized instruments are useful in identifying meaningful change in clinical outcomes over time. Despite these clinical recommendations, maternal depression is often underdiagnosed and untreated. Nearly 60% of women with depressive symptoms do not receive a clinical diagnosis, and 50% of women with a diagnosis do not receive any treatment (Ko et al. 2012). This measure encourages clinicians to screen new mothers for depression."

Description: "Functional Status Assessments for Congestive Heart Failure. Patients living with congestive heart failure (CHF) often have poor functional status and health-related quality of life, which declines as the disease progresses (Allen et al. 2012). In addition, their care is often complicated by multiple comorbidities. To assist in managing these complex patients, the American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association recommend collecting initial and repeat assessments of a patient's function and ability to complete desired activities of daily living (Hunt et al. 2009). The American Heart Association has also released scientific statements emphasizing the collection of patient-reported health status (for example, functional limitations, symptom burden, quality of life) from CHF patients as an important means of establishing a dynamic conversation between patient and provider regarding care goals and the patient's priorities (Allen et al. 2012; Rumsfeld et al. 2013)."

ACOG has recently reiterated its position (ACOG, 2007). A recent Cochrane review substantiates the benefits (Kramer et al., 2002). Much evidence has now focused on the prenatal and intrapartum period as critical for the success of exclusive (or any) BF (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2007; Petrova et al., 2007; Shealy et al., 2005; Taveras et al., 2004).
