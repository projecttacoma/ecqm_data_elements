Abstract Element: ActiveDatetime

Active dateTime is most often used to specify immunizations for which administration is intended at a specific time in the future. If Active dateTime is not specified, it defaults to the Author (signed) dateTime."

Abstract Element: AuthorDatetime
Description: "The time the data element was entered into the clinical software. Note, some datatypes include both Relevant Time and Author dateTime attributes. The purpose is to accommodate Author dateTime if the actual start and stop times are not available when evaluating for feasibility, and also to allow specification of a time for Negation Rationale."
Value: dateTime

Abstract Element: Components
Description: "Elements included or documented as part of evaluations or test panels. Examples include: specific questions included in assesments, tests included in a laboratory test panel, observations included in a cardiac exam during a physical examination.

Value: string
0..* CodingValueset

Abstract Element: Diagnoses
Description: "Coded diagnoses/problems addressed during the encounter. The diagnoses attribute is intended to capture ALL diagnoses, including principal diagnosis. Use of the Encounter, Performed: diagnoses attribute and the Diagnosis datatype is redundant for relating the diagnosis to the Encounter, Performed. The Encounter, Performed: diagnoses syntax is preferred. Referencing the same diagnosis using Encounter, Performed (diagnoses attribute) and Diagnosis (datatype) should only occur if the measure must define a specified length of a prevalence period, e.g., The measure must assure that the diagnoseis have been present for at least some defined time period before the encounter, and were addressed during the Encounter"

Abstract Element: Method
Description: "Indicates the procedure or technique used in its performance."
Value: Coding
0..* CodingValueset

Abstract Element: NegationRationale
Description: "Indicates the reason that an action was not performed. Only QDM datatypes that represent actions (e.g., performed, recommended, communication, order, dispensed) allow the “negation rationale” attribute. The intent is to indicate a justification that such action did not happen as expected. This attribute specifically does not address the presence or absence of information in a clinical record (e.g., documented absence of allergies Vs lack of documentation about allergies). The syntax in the human readable HQMF is address in CQL examples and in the MAT User Guide. Prior versions of QDM used the syntax, “Procedure, Performed not done.” QDM 5.0 DRAFT uses the syntax, “Procedure, not Performed.” Note: Some datatypes include both Relevant Time and Author dateTime attributes. The purpose is to accommodate Author dateTime if the actual start and stop times are not available when evaluating for feasibility, and also to allow specification of a time for Negation Rationale."
Value: Coding
0..* CodingValueset

Abstract Element: Ordinality
Description: "

Abstract Element: Reason
Description: "The thought process or justification for the datatype. In some measures, specific treatments are acceptable inclusion criteria only if a justified reason is present. Each of these measures uses a value set (often, but not exclusively, using SNOMED- CT®) to express acceptable justification reasons. Other measures specify reasons as justification for exclusions. Examples include patient, system, or medical-related reasons for declining to perform specific actions. Each of these measures also uses a value set to express acceptable justification reasons for declining to perform expected actions."

Value: string

Abstract Element: RelevantPeriod
Description: "Relevant Period addresses the time between the start of an action to the end of an action. Each datatype using relevant period defines specific definitions for the start and stop time for the action listed."
Value: TimePeriod

Abstract Element: Result
Description: "The final consequences or data collected from the datatype. Results can be used in five ways, to express: That a result is present in the electronic record but any entry is acceptable.  A numerical result is reported directly as a value. Values may be integers or decimal numbers without units, or as a quantity with a value and units – examples: 100 mg/dL for a lab test, 140 mmHg for blood pressure, as a percentage (actually a quantity with % as units), as a ratio (e.g., 1:4, 1:80). Beginning with QDM 5.3 measures use CQL logic to express the mathematical operators to constrain desired results to those above or below a certain threshold.  A result that matches one of a specific set of coded concepts in a value set or a code that matches a direct referenced code. A result as a dateTime (Assessment, Performed and components)."

Abstract Element: Supply
Description: "The quantity (amount) of therapeutic agent that was provided to a patient (i.e., number of doses, number of tablets or pills, volume of medication). Indicated to be given during a procedure, diagnostic test, or medication or substance administration. Note: Prior versions of the QDM (4.3 and earlier) addressed “dose” with two potential interpretations – (1) the quantity to be taken or administered with each administration and (2) the quantity of medication supplied (i.e., number of doses). QDM 5.0 and subsequent versions clarify the difference by defining “dosage” and “supply,” respectively. Note: Medication, Discharge includes medications the provider has indicated the patient should take after dischange from the hospital. This medication list is part of the discharge instructions provided to a patient. The list may include medication supply if it incorporates medication orders written at discharge even though the supply will not be present for medications the patient already has at home or purchases over- the-counter (without a prescription)."
