EntryElement: Device
Based on: QdmDataElement
Description: "Device represents an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in-vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and not dependent on being metabolized to achieve any of its primary intended purposes. Documented evidence of a device may exist in a clinical record in various ways. A provider may document placement of a device as an intervention or procedure (e.g., the QDM datatypes Intervention, Performed, or Procedure, Performed). Example: Procedure, Performed: Pacemaker insertion. The provider may document presence of the device as a finding, perhaps including the finding on the problem list. Example: Diagnosis: Pacemaker present, or Assessment, Performed: Pacemaker present. A provider may also document the device in a specific device use statement or assessment. Example: Device, Applied: Transtelephonic monitoring of pacemaker assessment. e Note that the current use of the QDM datatype “Device, Applied” usually references the procedure to “apply” the device (i.e., to use for the patient, to use on the patient’s body, or to implant in the patient’s body). Each of these current uses should address the concept using the QDM datatypes, Intervention, Performed, or Procedure, Performed. Given the variation in determining evidence of device usage, a measure developer may need to include multiple queries (or retrieves) to assure capture of all devices present in the measure population. The QDM datatype, Device, Applied, provides the best method to determine specific details about the device in use if a device usage assessment exists to provide such information. It also allow a measure developer to expicitly express which devices should be included in the query."

Diagnostic studies may make use of digital images and textual reports. Such studies include but are not limited to imaging studies, cardiology studies (electrocardiogram, treadmill stress testing), pulmonary-function testing, vascular laboratory testing, and others."

The request may be in the form of a consultation or a direct order to the organization that performs the diagnostic study. Diagnostic studies are those that are not performed in the clinical laboratory. Such studies include but are not limited to imaging studies, cardiology studies (electrocardiogram, treadmill stress testing), pulmonary function testing, vascular laboratory testing, and others."

Based on: QdmDataElement
Description: "Encounter represents an identifiable grouping of healthcare-related activities characterized by the entity relationship between the subject of care and a healthcare provider; such a grouping is determined by the healthcare provider.14 A patient encounter represents interaction between a healthcare provider and a patient with a face-to-face patient visit to a clinician’s office, or any electronically remote interaction with a clinician for any form of diagnostic treatment or therapeutic event. Encounters can be billable events but are not limited to billable interactions. Each encounter has an associated location or modality within which it occurred (such as an office, home, electronic methods, phone encounter, or telemedicine methods). The encounter location is the patient’s location at the time of measurement. Different levels of interaction can be specified in the value associated with the element while modes of interaction (e.g., telephone) may be modeled using the data flow attribute."

Description: "Data elements that meet criteria using this datatype should document that a prescription for the medication indicated by the QDM category and its corresponding value set has been dispensed and provided to the patient or patient proxy. In the ambulatory setting, medications are primarily taken directly by patients and not directly observed. Hence, dispensed, or fulfillment, information is the closest health provider documentation of medication compliance. In settings where patients attest to taking medications in electronic format (perhaps a Personal Health Record), patient attestation of medication taken may be available. The QDM datatype, Medication, Administered addresses medication taken; to address the source of the information, a measure addressing such patient attestation would require use of the dataflow attribute, source."

Substance may or may not have a code or be classified by a code system such RxNorm. Examples of a substance may include environmental agents (e.g., pollen, dust) and food (e.g., vitamins). Measure developers have considered the use of the QDM substance category in light of alignment with existing interoperability data standards."
