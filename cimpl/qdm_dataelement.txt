EntryElement: Diagnosis
Based on: Observation
Description: "Condition/Diagnosis/Problem represents a practitioner’s identification of a patient’s disease, illness, injury, or condition. This category contains a single datatype to represent all of these concepts: Diagnosis. A practitioner determines the diagnosis by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history. Diagnoses are usually considered unfavorable, but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient’s plan of care (e.g., pregnancy). The QDM does not prescribe the source of diagnosis data in the EHR. Diagnoses may be found in a patient’s problem list, encounter diagnosis list, claims data, or other sources within the EHR. The preferred terminology for diagnoses is SNOMED CT, but diagnoses may also be encoded using ICD-9/10. The Diagnosis datatype should not be used for differential diagnoses or rule-out diagnoses (neither of which are currently supported by the QDM)."

The QDM defines diagnostic studies as those that are not performed in organizations that perform testing on samples of human blood, tissue, or other substance from the body. Diagnostic studies may make use of digital images and textual reports.

EntryElement: Encounter
Based on: Activity
Description: "Encounter represents an identifiable grouping of healthcare-related activities characterized by the entity relationship between the subject of care and a healthcare provider; such a grouping is determined by the healthcare provider. A patient encounter represents interaction between a healthcare provider and a patient with a face-to-face patient visit to a clinician’s office, or any electronically remote interaction with a clinician for any form of diagnostic treatment or therapeutic event. Encounters can be billable events but are not limited to billable interactions. Each encounter has an associated location or modality within which it occurred (such as an office, home, electronic methods, phone encounter, or telemedicine methods). The encounter location is the patient’s location at the time of measurement. Different levels of interaction can be specified in the value associated with the element while modes of interaction (e.g., telephone) may be modeled using the data flow attribute."

EntryElement: MedicationDispensed
Based on: Observation
Description: "Data elements that meet criteria using this datatype should document that a prescription for the medication indicated by the QDM category and its corresponding value set has been dispensed and provided to the patient or patient proxy. In the ambulatory setting, medications are primarily taken directly by patients and not directly observed. Hence, dispensed, or fulfillment, information is the closest health provider documentation of medication compliance. In settings where patients attest to taking medications in electronic format (perhaps a Personal Health Record), patient attestation of medication taken may be available. The QDM datatype, Medication, Administered addresses medication taken; to address the source of the information, a measure addressing such patient attestation would require use of the dataflow attribute, source. Timing: The time the medication dispensing event occurs; the Author dateTime. Timing: The Relevant Period addresses: startTime = when the first administration of the medication is expected. If not specified. the startTime defaults to the Author dateTime (the time the medication dispensing event occurs). stopTime = when the medication supply provided by the dispensing event is expected to be completed. Note that when calculating cumulative medication duration, the medication dispensed stopTime may be present directly in the fulfillment record. If the stopTime is not available, the duration in days is the difference between the Relevant Period start and stop times. The record may indicate which of the available refills the fulfillment represents but each dispensing event is unique. Therefore, the measure developer should use CQL logic to address multiple dispensing events over a period of time."

The first administration may be expected at the time of the order or at a specified future date (i.e., the active time for the order); such information should be identified in the medication order. If the startTime is not specified in the order, the startTime defaults to the Author dateTime (the time the order is signed). stopTime = when the medication supply provided by the medication order is expected to be completed, including all fulfillments covered by the number of refills. Note that when calculating cumulative medication duration, the stopTime may be present directly in the medication order. If the stopTime is not available, the duration in days is the difference between the Relevant Period start and stop times multiplied by (1 + the number of refills)."
