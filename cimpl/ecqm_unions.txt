Based on: Union4
Description: "Union of data elements used to document the administration of the laboratory test present in the patient's medical record. On occasion, providers will view HIV screening results that were performed elsewhere and therefore the results are not present in the EHR in structured format. To allow such tests to be applied to this measure, they should be entered into the EHR as a laboratory test in a manner consistent with the EHR in use. If the specific Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Laboratory Test LOINC code of the test is not known, the entry should use the more generic code LOINC panel code [75622-1] which is present in the HIV test value set titled, 'HIV Test Documentation Reviewed.'"
