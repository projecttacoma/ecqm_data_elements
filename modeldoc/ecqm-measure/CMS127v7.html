          <div class="block"><p>Pneumococcal Vaccination Status for Older Adults. Pneumonia is a common cause of illness and death in the elderly and persons with certain underlying conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, asthma, sickle cell anemia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (NHLBI, 2011). In 1998, an estimated 3,400 adults aged &gt; 65 years died as a result of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (CDC, 2003). Among the 91.5 million US adults aged &gt; 50 years, 29,500 cases of IPD, 502,600 cases of nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 25,400 pneumococcal-related deaths are estimated to occur yearly; annual direct and indirect costs are estimated to total $3.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Pneumococcal disease remains a substantial burden among older US adults, despite increased coverage with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, (PPV23) and indirect benefits afforded by PCV7 vaccination of young children (Weycker, et al., 2011). Vaccination has been found to be effective against bacteremic cases (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.27-0.66) as well as nonbacteremic cases (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.39-0.86). Vaccine effectiveness was highest against bacteremic infections caused by vaccine types (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.09-0.66) (Vila-Corcoles, et al., 2009).</p></div>
