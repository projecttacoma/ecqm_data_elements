          <div class="block"><p>Use of High-Risk Medications in the Elderly. Older adults receiving inappropriate medications are more likely to report poorer health status at follow-up, compared to those who receive appropriate medications (Fu, Liu, and Christensen 2004). A study of the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults found that 40 percent of individuals 65 and older filled at least one prescription for a potentially inappropriate medication and 13 percent filled two or more (Fick et al. 2008). While some adverse drug events are not preventable, studies estimate that between 30 and 80 percent of adverse drug events in the elderly are preventable (MacKinnon and Hepler 2003). Reducing the number of inappropriate prescriptions can lead to improved patient safety and significant cost savings.  Conservative estimates of extra costs due to potentially inappropriate medications in the elderly average $7.2 billion a year (Fu et al. 2007). Medication use by older adults will likely increase further as the U.S. population ages, new drugs are developed, and new therapeutic and preventive uses for medications are discovered (Rothberg et al. 2008). The annual direct costs of preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) in the Medicare population have been estimated to exceed $800 million (IOM, 2007). By the year 2030, nearly one in five U.S. residents is expected to be aged 65 years or older; this age group is projected to more than double in number from 38.7 million in 2008 to more than 88.5 million in 2050.  Likewise, the population aged 85 years or older is expected to increase almost four-fold, from 5.4 million to 19 million between 2008 and 2050.  As the elderly population continues to grow, the number of older adults who present with multiple medical conditions for which several medications are prescribed continues to increase, resulting in polypharmacy (Gray and Gardner 2009).</p></div>

Timing: The Relevant Period addresses: startTime – The time the encounter began (admission time) stopTime – The time the encounter ended (discharge time). The Author dateTime addresses when an Encounter is documented. Documentation can occur at the beginning, during, at the end or subsequent to the end of an Encounter. The Author dateTime should be used only if the Relevant Period cannot be obtained. The Location Period is an attribute of the attribute facility location addresses: startTime = the time the patient arrived at the location; stopTime = the time the patient departed from the location</div>
