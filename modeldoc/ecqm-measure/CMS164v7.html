          <div class="block"><p>Ischemic Vascular Disease (IVD): Use of Aspirin or Another Antiplatelet. Cardiovascular disease, including stroke, is the leading cause of death in the United States. More than 92.1 million American adults have one or more types of cardiovascular disease. Specifically, more than 16 million adults (20 years and older) have coronary heart disease (CHD), over 8 million adults have angina, more than 7 million adults have had a myocardial infarction (MI), over 7 million adults have had a stroke, and nearly 7 million adults 40 years of age and older have peripheral artery disease (Benjamin et al., 2017). It is estimated that by 2030 more than 44 percent of Americans will have a form of cardiovascular disease (Heidenreich et al., 2011). In 2011, the total cost of cardiovascular disease and stroke in the United States was estimated to be $320 billion. This total includes direct costs such as the cost of physicians and other health professionals, hospital services, prescribed medications and home health care, as well as indirect costs due to loss of productivity from premature mortality (Benjamin et al., 2017). By 2030, direct medical costs for cardiovascular disease are projected to increase to nearly $918 billion (Heidenreich, 2011). Antiplatelet medications, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, are drugs that inhibit platelets from clumping together and forming clots. Their use in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is well established.  In patients who are at high risk because they already have occlusive cardiovascular disease, long-term antiplatelet therapy reduces the yearly risk of serious vascular events (MI, stroke, death) by about twenty-five percent (Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration, 1994; 2002; 2009). A more recent systematic review of the literature confirmed the benefits of antiplatelet therapy in reducing death from cardiovascular causes, MI, or stroke (Cheng, 2013). Antiplatelet agents also have a beneficial effect in reducing all-cause mortality and fatal cardiovascular events in patients with peripheral arterial disease (Wong et al., 2011).</p></div>

Diagnoses are usually considered unfavorable, but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient’s plan of care (e.g., pregnancy). The QDM does not prescribe the source of diagnosis data in the EHR. Diagnoses may be found in a patient’s problem list, encounter diagnosis list, claims data, or other sources within the EHR.

      <div><b>Diagnosis:</b> Condition/Diagnosis/Problem represents a practitioner’s identification of a patient’s disease, illness, injury, or condition. This category contains a single datatype to represent all of these concepts: Diagnosis. A practitioner determines the diagnosis by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history. Diagnoses are usually considered unfavorable, but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient’s plan of care (e.g., pregnancy). The QDM does not prescribe the source of diagnosis data in the EHR. Diagnoses may be found in a patient’s problem list, encounter diagnosis list, claims data, or other sources within the EHR. The preferred terminology for diagnoses is SNOMED-CT, but diagnoses may also be encoded using ICD-9/10. The Diagnosis datatype should not be used for differential diagnoses or rule-out diagnoses (neither of which are currently supported by the QDM).</div>
