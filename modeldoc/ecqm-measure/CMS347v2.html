          <div class="block"><p>Statin Therapy for the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease. 'Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, causing approximately 1 of every 7 deaths in the United States in 2011. In 2011, stroke caused approximately 1 of every 20 deaths in the United States and the estimated annual costs for CVD and stroke were $320.1 billion, including $195.6 billion in direct costs (hospital services, physicians and other professionals, prescribed medications, home health care, and other medical durables) and $124.5 billion in indirect costs from lost future productivity (cardiovascular and stroke premature deaths). CVD costs more than any other diagnostic group' (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). Data collected between 2009 and 2012 indicates that more than 100 million U.S. adults, 20 years or older, had total cholesterol levels equal to 200 mg/dL or more, while almost 31 million had levels 240 mg/dL or more (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). Elevated blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for CVD and statin therapy has been associated with a reduced risk of CVD. Numerous randomized trials have demonstrated that treatment with a statin reduces LDL-C, and reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events by approximately 20 percent (Ference, 2015). In 2013, guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults were published (see Stone et al., 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults: a Report of the American College of Cardiology [ACC]/American Heart Association [AHA] Task Force on Practice Guidelines). This guideline was published by an Expert Panel, which synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials to identify people most likely to benefit from cholesterol-lowering therapy. The ACC/AHA Guideline recommendations are intended to provide a strong evidence-based foundation for the treatment of blood cholesterol for the primary and secondary prevention and treatment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) in adult men and women (21 years of age or older). The document concludes the addition of statin therapy reduces the risk of ASCVD among high-risk individuals, defined as follows: individuals with clinical ASCVD, with LDL-C &gt;= 190 mg/dL, or with diabetes and LDL-C 70-189 mg/dL (Stone et al., 2013). However, one study that surveyed U.S. cardiovascular practices participating in the PINNACLE registry, found that 32.4 percent of patients with an indication for statins under the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines were not currently receiving them (Maddox et al., 2014). Although, systematic evidence review found that statins are safe drugs with low incidence of conditions or diseases attributable to statin use (Law et al., 2006). Overall, the Statin Safety Expert Panel that participated in an NLA Statin Safety Task Force meeting in October 2013 reaffirms the general safety of statin therapy. The panel members concluded that for most patients requiring statin therapy, the potential benefits of statin therapy outweigh the potential risks. In general terms, the benefits of statins to prevent non-fatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, stroke, and CVD mortality, far outweighs any potential harm related to the drug (Jacobson, 2014).</p></div>

Note that when calculating cumulative medication duration, the stopTime may be present directly in the medication order. If the stopTime is not available, the duration in days is the difference between the Relevant Period start and stop times multiplied by (1 + the number of refills).
