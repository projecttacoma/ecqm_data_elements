          <div class="block"><p>Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Poor Control (&gt; 9%). As the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., diabetes kills approximately 79,500 people a year (CDC Health  2017). Diabetes is a long lasting disease marked by high blood glucose levels, resulting from the body's inability to produce or use insulin properly (CDC About Diabetes 2017). People with diabetes are at increased risk of serious health complications including vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, amputation of toes, feet or legs, and premature death. (CDC At a Glance 2016). In 2012, diabetes cost the U.S. an estimated $245 billion: $176 billion in direct medical costs and $69 billion in reduced productivity. This is a 41 percent increase from the estimated $174 billion spent on diabetes in 2007 (ADA Economic 2013).  Reducing A1c blood level results by 1 percentage point (eg, from 8.0 percent to 7.0 percent) helps reduce the risk of microvascular complications (eye, kidney and nerve diseases) by as much as 40 percent (CDC Estimates 2011).</p></div>

      <div><b>Diagnosis:</b> Condition/Diagnosis/Problem represents a practitioner’s identification of a patient’s disease, illness, injury, or condition. This category contains a single datatype to represent all of these concepts: Diagnosis. A practitioner determines the diagnosis by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history. Diagnoses are usually considered unfavorable, but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient’s plan of care (e.g., pregnancy). The QDM does not prescribe the source of diagnosis data in the EHR. Diagnoses may be found in a patient’s problem list, encounter diagnosis list, claims data, or other sources within the EHR. The preferred terminology for diagnoses is SNOMED-CT, but diagnoses may also be encoded using ICD-9/10. The Diagnosis datatype should not be used for differential diagnoses or rule-out diagnoses (neither of which are currently supported by the QDM).</div>

      <div><b>Diagnosis:</b> Condition/Diagnosis/Problem represents a practitioner’s identification of a patient’s disease, illness, injury, or condition. This category contains a single datatype to represent all of these concepts: Diagnosis. A practitioner determines the diagnosis by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history. Diagnoses are usually considered unfavorable, but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient’s plan of care (e.g., pregnancy). The QDM does not prescribe the source of diagnosis data in the EHR. Diagnoses may be found in a patient’s problem list, encounter diagnosis list, claims data, or other sources within the EHR. The preferred terminology for diagnoses is SNOMED-CT, but diagnoses may also be encoded using ICD-9/10. The Diagnosis datatype should not be used for differential diagnoses or rule-out diagnoses (neither of which are currently supported by the QDM).</div>
