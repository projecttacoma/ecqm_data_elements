Tobacco users who are able to stop using tobacco lower their risk for heart disease, lung disease, and stroke.</p></div>

      <div><b>Data Element Scope: </b> The intent of this data element is to identify patients who are deemed to have limited life expectancy. Using the Quality Data Model, this data element would map to the Diagnosis category.</div>

</div>
      
      <div><b>Diagnosis:</b> Condition/Diagnosis/Problem represents a practitioner’s identification of a patient’s disease, illness, injury, or condition. This category contains a single datatype to represent all of these concepts: Diagnosis. A practitioner determines the diagnosis by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history. Diagnoses are usually considered unfavorable, but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient’s plan of care (e.g., pregnancy). The QDM does not prescribe the source of diagnosis data in the EHR. Diagnoses may be found in a patient’s problem list, encounter diagnosis list, claims data, or other sources within the EHR. The preferred terminology for diagnoses is SNOMED-CT, but diagnoses may also be encoded using ICD-9/10. The Diagnosis datatype should not be used for differential diagnoses or rule-out diagnoses (neither of which are currently supported by the QDM).</div>

Timing: The Author dateTime is the time the order is signed. Timing: The Relevant Period addresses: startTime = when the first administration of the medication is expected. The first administration may be expected at the time of the order or at a specified future date (i.e., the active time for the order); such information should be identified in the medication order. If the startTime is not specified in the order, the startTime defaults to the Author dateTime (the time the order is signed). stopTime = when the medication supply provided by the medication order is expected to be completed, including all fulfillments covered by the number of refills. Note that when calculating cumulative medication duration, the stopTime may be present directly in the medication order. If the stopTime is not available, the duration in days is the difference between the Relevant Period start and stop times multiplied by (1 + the number of refills). Refer to Special Cases in Appendix A (Section A.3) for scenarios to consider in calculating cumulative medication duration.</div>

      <div><b>Diagnosis:</b> Condition/Diagnosis/Problem represents a practitioner’s identification of a patient’s disease, illness, injury, or condition. This category contains a single datatype to represent all of these concepts: Diagnosis. A practitioner determines the diagnosis by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history. Diagnoses are usually considered unfavorable, but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient’s plan of care (e.g., pregnancy). The QDM does not prescribe the source of diagnosis data in the EHR. Diagnoses may be found in a patient’s problem list, encounter diagnosis list, claims data, or other sources within the EHR. The preferred terminology for diagnoses is SNOMED-CT, but diagnoses may also be encoded using ICD-9/10. The Diagnosis datatype should not be used for differential diagnoses or rule-out diagnoses (neither of which are currently supported by the QDM).</div>

The Author dateTime addresses when an Encounter is documented. Documentation can occur at the beginning, during, at the end or subsequent to the end of an Encounter. The Author dateTime should be used only if the Relevant Period cannot be obtained.

The first administration may be expected at the time of the order or at a specified future date (i.e., the active time for the order); such information should be identified in the medication order. If the startTime is not specified in the order, the startTime defaults to the Author dateTime (the time the order is signed). stopTime = when the medication supply provided by the medication order is expected to be completed, including all fulfillments covered by the number of refills. Note that when calculating cumulative medication duration, the stopTime may be present directly in the medication order. If the stopTime is not available, the duration in days is the difference between the Relevant Period start and stop times multiplied by (1 + the number of refills). Refer to Special Cases in Appendix A (Section A.3) for scenarios to consider in calculating cumulative medication duration.</div>
