          <div class="block"><p>Adult Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): Suicide Risk Assessment. Research has shown that more than 90% of people who kill themselves have depression or another diagnosable mental or substance abuse disorder. Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the reported suicides in the U.S. each year. The intent of this measure is for a clinician to assess suicide risk at initial intake or at the visit in which depression was diagnosed. As the guidelines state, it is important to assess for additional factors which may increase or decrease suicide risk, such as presence of additional symptoms (eg, psychosis, severe anxiety, hopelessness, severe chronic pain); presence of substance abuse, history and seriousness of previous attempts, particularly, recent suicidal behavior, current stressors and potential protective factors (eg, positive reasons for living, strong social support), family history of suicide or mental illness or recent exposure to suicide, impulsivity and potential for risk to others, including history of violence or violent or homicidal ideas, plans, or intentions, and putting one's affairs in order (eg, giving away possessions, writing a will). In addition, although the measure focuses on the initial visit, it is critical that suicide risk be monitored especially for the 90 days following the initial visit and throughout MDD treatment.</p></div>
